This project deployed on netlify https://birthday-tracker-react.netlify.app

Overall, the flow of the application should look something like this:

- Import the data want to render in App.jsx.
- Set up the data as a state variable using useState.
- Use the map method to iterate over the data array and render a Person component for each person.
- Each Person component should render an image with a style prop to control the width, the person's name, and the person's age.
- Create a List component that holds the rendered items.
- Create a button with functionality to clear the list.
- Display the number of items in the list using the length property of the state variable. This can be rendered using plain text or added to a message or heading element.
